# Ecommerce Website

Developed a fully responsive e-commerce website, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved creating a comprehensive user interface with a homepage, product category pages, individual product pages, user authentication (sign-up/login), and a fully functional shopping cart. I focused on creating an interconnected web application where each page is seamlessly linked to the next, ensuring smooth navigation and usability throughout the shopping website.
